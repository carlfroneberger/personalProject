					A trip to Maine
				</h1>
				<p>
					This February break, I took a trip to Maine for vacation. These are my thoughts about the weather, the places, and the trip.</p>
				<h2>The Weather</h2>
				<p>This was probably the coldest weather that I have ever experienced. Maine is on track to set the record for its coldest February ever, and I can attest that that is probably accurate. When I arrived, the temperature was four below zero, but it did begin to warm up toward the latter part of the week.
