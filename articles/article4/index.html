					A trip to Maine
				</h1>
				<p>
					This February break, I took a trip to Maine for vacation. These are my thoughts about the weather, the places, and the trip.</p>
				<h2>The Weather</h2>
				<p>This was probably the coldest weather that I have ever experienced. Maine is on track to set the record for its coldest February ever, and I can attest that that is probably accurate. When I arrived, the temperature was four below zero, but it did begin to warm up toward the latter part of the week as snow started to arrive. One of my favorite parts about travel is seeing the weather in other parts of the world. Whether it is hot, cold, humid, or dry, I love it all. Especially the more extreme or different it is from where I am, the better it is. This certainly satisfied the cold part of my diet for weather. I also saw more snow than I ever had in my life. Despite the fact that there was supposed to be a blizzard that dumped two feet that never came, I had never experienced such great quantities of that white, fluffy stuff. In the average place, there were about two and a half feet, but it drifted to about five feet in some places. Some snow piles were even reaching fifteen to twenty feet. To me, it is shocking and amazing how people can function with so much of it, as opposed to in Atlanta, where two inches can shut the city down. Despite the vast quantities on the ground, the roads were as clear as in summer (with only a bit of sand and salt on them.) When I planned my trip in the fall, I wanted cold, snowy weather, and Maine's winter did not dissapoint me.</p>
				<h2>The places</h2>
				<p>Although I did not travel around the state very much, I did get a much better feel for the place. One of the things that I noticed when driving around the state was that Maine has its own distinctive style of architecture. I am still not sure if it is something that is shared throughout all of New England or just Maine in particular. The buildings have an indescribable feel to them, historic and weathered, but also resolute and solid. I also went to Camden Hills State Park and stayed at a ski shelter for a night. This allowed me to get a better sense of the Maine wilderness. It is a slightly mountainous place, mainly filled with medium to large hills. The wind is another thing that I noticed when I was there. It may have been a weather oddity, but one thing that stuck out was how hard it blew. In the south, there is not much wind. On the average day, there are a few gusts, but they never really exceed a certain speed. Up in the north, it blew almost constantly and much faster than I was used to. It made the cold even colder.</p>
				<h2>The trip</h2>
				<p>Overall, this was a very nice trip for me. I was able to see a part of the country that I hadn't seen in a while in completely different weather than I was used to. I felt that one thing that had been missing from my childhood was never having a real winter. I had never known what it felt like to have to get super bundled up to just go to the store for some milk. It had always been warm enough to just have to wear a hoodie. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I am looking to go back in the summer to experience it again.</p>
