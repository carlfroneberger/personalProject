This is a website about me, Carl Froneberger. I will be updating it periodically with new information. It is a part of my sophomore project. It was made using HTML, CSS, JS, and soon, PHP. There is little actual information on the site, it is only a coding playground right now. I am hosting it on an Ubuntu 12.10 32 bit server. It has 512 MB of RAM and 30 GB of storage. It should be a lot faster than a Raspberry Pi connected to my cruddy internet, so let's see if it pays off. I hope to add a usable PHP comment system as soon as I have time. I also hope to sort the links out as soon as is possible. You will encounter many broken links, stylesheets that haven't loaded, and scripts that haven't loaded on this site.<br>

							Recently, Arsenal have been doing extremely well. After few poor games in the past months, like the two nil defeat to Southampton and the three two defeat to Stoke, the Gunners are bouncing back with spring in their step from many wins and players returning from injury.<br>

							For Christmas, I received an Xbox One and a soccer video game called FIFA 15. I have been playing it and its different game modes for a little while now, and these are my experiences with it.<br>

							Recently, I have taken up the hobby of ice skating. I began just as winter break began for me, wich was towards the end of December. It started as a way to fight off the boredom of the pre-Christmas week, but later transformed into something that I very much enjoy. I have greatly approved in my abilities since I set foot on the ice several weeks ago.<br>
