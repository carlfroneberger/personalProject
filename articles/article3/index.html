			<h1>My experiences with FIFA</h1>
			<p>For Christmas, I received an Xbox One and a soccer video game called FIFA 15. I have been playing it and its different game modes for a little while now, and these are my experiences with it</p>
			<h2>Difficulty levels</h2>
			<p>One thing that I have noticed about the difficulty levels is that there is a massive disparity between them. This is especially apparrent when I was playing career mode for Arsenal. In the FA Cup semi-final, I was able to beat Manchester City seven nil. After that, I decided that I must change the difficulty level because there was no way that I wouldn't be able to win. I was pretty sure that I might even have to up the difficulty again after that. Nope. It was just a regular Premier League game against a struggling Southampton. I held on to a draw for the first 85 minutes, but then my luck ended. A pass from half field from Victor Wanyama ended up at the head of Pelle, and then it finally went into the back of my net. After Southampton's defense thwarting all of my efforts on goal and breaking up all of my threatening  plays, I was frustrated. I knew that I'd have to try harder next time, but I was confident that I could match professional difficulty level's challenge. Sadly, I was wrong. After losing to Hull, drawing to QPR and Burnley, and having no fun, I decided to go back to semi-pro. I'd rather have fun and make it unrealistic in my favor than get frustrated and make it unrealistic against my favor.</p>
			<h2>FIFA Ultimate Team</h2>
			<p>I have recently begun playing FUT. For those of you that don't know, it is a gamemode that allows you to build a team buy getting players by either drawing them from packs, or by buying them from other players on the transfer market. The goal is to have players with a large number of similar attributes (like same league, same team, or same nationality). These give your team a better chemistry, which in turn makes it better overall. The goal is to win as many games with your team as is possible so that you can move up the leagues and play better and better opponents. I am currently in league 8 because I have not been playing for very long. One thing that I have noticed is that there are two types of teams in these lower leagues. There are the players that are not very good, but are able to be in the league because the players that they have are very good. These are the worst types of players because you know that they used USD to get better players and win matches. It is obvious that they are not as good because you are outmaneuvering them on every occasion and frequently drawing fouls. The only areas that you fall short in are physicality. It is impossible to match Bale's pace or Benzema's physicality. They work you off of the ball and you can't do anything about it. I have found that these are also the type of people that have to watch all of the replays for their mediocre goals. Even though they ran in a straight line and beat your 79 rated keeper with an average shot, they just need to watch the whole thing four times. It takes no skill whatsoever to do what they do. It only takes money. I usually lose knowing that had I had the same team, I could have roasted them. But when you beat a rich ten year old Real Madrid fanboy who has Bale, Ronaldo, James, and Kroos with O'Shea, Bernard, and Alex, it makes it all the sweeter. The other type of player is what I consider myself to be. They are pretty average at playing the game, and they have an average team. Unfortunately, it is harder for them to get up because of the competition. They usually get their goals through skill and nice passing rather than using brute force against their oponnent. Even if they score, at least it was pretty so that you can appreciate it a bit. Even then, they understand that their opponnent doesn't want to watch the goal against them four times, so they only replay it once and then go back to the kickoff.</p>
			<h2>FIFA AI</h2>
			<p>One of the main problems with FIFA that I have noticed is how terrible the AI can be. I have conceded many goals because my defenders have run into each other, causing them to both fall, and then giving the ball away to a forward who slams it in. It is frustrating many times how stupid the players can be. They stop their runs right as a through ball is being passed, they can't cut a ball out that goes a foot away from them, and they pass it into the other team's players. It is something that absolutely has to be fixed soon. It is incredibly frustrating to play like this. The goalkeepers are not exempted from this bad programming. A finesse shot from thirty meters out somehow beat 82 rated David de Gea even though it was only one meter above and one meter to the left of his original position. He did not have the intelligence to back a step up and jump, he just stood there. But despite this, I still can't get over how fun the game is and how badly I want to keep getting better. I do, however, sincerely hope that EA does something good for once in their existence and fixes these problems that everyone has and that no one likes</p>
