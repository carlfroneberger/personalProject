				<h1>Arsenal's recent performances</h1>
				<img src="images/arsenal.png" alt="arsenal logo"/>
				<p>Recently, Arsenal have been doing extremely well. After few poor games in the past months, like the two nil defeat to Southampton and the three two defeat to Stoke, the Gunners are bouncing back with spring in their step from many wins and players returning from injury.</p>
				<h1>Ospina as the new number one</h1>
				<p>Due to Szczesny's recent poor performance against Southampton, it appeared time for a change. Both goals could have been attributed to goalkeeping mistakes. After that, Wenger decided to begin using Ospina more and more often. Ospina has begun to prove that he is more than up to the task. He has conceded very few goals the entire season and is beginning to prove that he can step up when needed. Although he has still not made many big saves, he has shown that he can make them. He has appeared much more confident in the box than Szczeny has. I hope he continues to perform and do as well as he has been. As for Szczesny, he has to get his performance together for him to regain hist starting position as the main number one.</p>
				<h1>Bellerin's progress</h1>
				<p>Due to Arsenal's injury crisis, that has thankfully since passed, there were many positions requiring many new and inexperienced players to start. One of these was Hector Bellerin, the 19 year old spaniard. I have been incredibly impressed by him so far. He seems to be very confident in his positioning, and he always knows where to be. He has shown that he can not only defend, but he can also perform offensively. He had a great assist that lead to a stunning Giroud finish, and he just put his first goal in the books today against Villa. One thing that I believe has certainly helped him is his pace. He is faster than Walcott, Arsenal's fastest player, at completin the 40m sprint. Granted, it is only by .01 seconds, but that is still one hard thing to achieve. At the beginning of the season, Chambers was filling in the right back position, but it was easy to see that he was terrible against wingers with pace. It was one of the main ways that Swansea won at home after conceding a goal from Alexis. Chambers has to mature as a player because many times he makes mistakes that he cannot recover from. Bellerin's pace allows him to recover from mistakes that he makes because of inexperience. Due to Debuchy's shoulder injury that will leave him out for three months, I am sure that Bellerin will continue to grow and perform. He looks like he will be a great asset to have in the future. He is already proving that he can perform at the highest level at his young age.</p>
				<h1>Coqelin's role</h1>
				<p>Another player who has come out of the injury crisis is Francis Coqelin. Recalled from his loan spell at Charleton, he has shown his worth in many ways. In the four-one-four-one formation that Wenger has been using recently, he is playing as the one defensive midfield player. In the games that he has played, he has shown that he is very commanding of that area. Coqelin is one of the main reasons that Arsenal were able to win away against Man City. He constantly occupied the space in the middle between the midfielders and the defenders. In many of the replays, Coqelin can be seen scanning the area, constantly tracking the movements of players like Ag&uuml;ero and Silva. He also posesses a physical game, something that Arsenal have been lacking. Against physical teams like Stoke and Chelsea, it is clear that Arsenal aren't as large or physical as their oponents. They prefer to pass around them, but never go forward. Coqelin has shown that he is ready to make the dirty, but necessary tackles. He won't back down. This been extremely visible, especially in aerial duels. Against Man City, he won 88% of his aerial duels, a hard feat to achieve considering he's only average in height (5'8"). Coqelin is another reason that Arsenal have been able to perform so well in their past few games.</p>
				<h1>Reformed tactics</h1>
				<p>Arsene Wenger's tactics have usually been the same. He is often criticized for not having a plan B. Against Man City, we were able to see a shift. He let the opposition control possession. The stats were some of the lowest that Arsenal had had in years. Instead, Arsenal sat back and let Man City have possession. Arsenal's attacking four rarely went forward. Instead, they pressured the ball and made sure to deny space. They would spring on the counter, but make sure not to get too stretched if there were a turnover. Again, against Villa, Arsenal had only 48% possession, but they proved that they don't need it to score goals. Many came fast and on the counter. I hope this is the start of a new, more counteracking style of football that Arsenal play with players like Cazorla, &Ouml;zil, Alexis, and Walcott.</p>
			<h1>Preffered formation</h1>
			<p>Many players recently have shown their ability and are all trying to get in the starting 11. I believe that right now, the best formation is a four-one-four-one. At left back, Nacho Monreal would be playing. He has recently shown his consistency. Gibbs is a great player, but he needs to develop more to achieve greater consistency. They are both great players for the role, though. At LCB, Koscielny has proven to be the best man for the job, stopping all sorts of attacks. Beside him, Mertesacker is still the best option. However, he does need to be replaced soon. He is getting old and is not pacy or consistent enough for a top team. Without Kos, he sometimes looks lost. However, after his terrible performance awway against Stoke, he has shown that he can respond to criticism and has certainly stepped up his game. Chambers can also fulfill this position, but only against lower teams. He is inexperienced, but he has potential. At RB, Debuchy is normally the best option, but he is injured. Right now, Bellerin has been phenomenal and hardly a step down. There doesn't seem to be anyone challenging for his spot, so he will likely stay for a while. Coqelin has also been doing extremely well as aforementioned. He has been providing exactly what the team needs in a CDM. Hopefully, Arsenal can get Schneiderlin for his passing abilities in the summer. The top four have been performing extremely well. Alexis is of course up there. For me, I'd put him at left wing (like he has been playing for nearly the entire season.) He is naturally a right wing, but he has been enjoying himself out there. He frequently cuts inside and puts it past the keeper. Just to the right of him would be &Ouml;zil. He has been plaing extremely well. His passes are great, and he is very aware. The end of the season will most likely see him continue to perform at a high level. He has scored two goals in two games and gotten one assist. There have been problems in the past with him playing on the wing, but he is showing that he will drift all over and make the plays where they need to be made. The other CAM has to be Cazorla. He has been in outstanding form. He is making key passes all over the attacking third and putting penalties in the back of the net time and time again. His touch and awareness add a new level to the team. Thomas Rosiscky has also been showing his abilities in this area. Sadly, he is becoming older and can't play as long, but he is a fantastic sub and great at playing the first sixty minutes. He is showing incredible energy, but it is sad knowing that he will retire soon. On the right wing, Walcott is the way to go. He is soon going to be right back in form after a very long absence. He is very pacey and invaluable on the coutner. Up top, Giroud seems to be the main man. He is great at holding up play. His physical presence is very useful on corners and for crosses. He is not the best with the ball, but he is very clinical with shots where he does not have much time to think. Hesitation is one o his main problems. The other man gunning for his position is Danny Welbeck. He is pacy, but looks almost as bad as Sanogo on the ball. He has shown that he can score, but not consistently. With a bit of practice, he can certainly start achieveing more. He should be back in the squad after an injury.
