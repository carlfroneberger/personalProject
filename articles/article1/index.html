				<h1>
					My first website
				</h1>
				<p>This is a website about me, Carl Froneberger. I will be updating it periodically with new information. It is a part of my sophomore project. It was made using HTML, CSS, JS, and soon, PHP. There is little actual information on the site, it is only a coding playground right now. I am hosting it on an Ubuntu 12.10 32 bit server. It has 512 MB of RAM and 30 GB of storage. It should be a lot faster than a Raspberry Pi connected to my cruddy internet, so let's see if it pays off. I hope to add a usable PHP comment system as soon as I have time. I also hope to sort the links out as soon as is possible. You will encounter many broken links, stylesheets that haven't loaded, and scripts that haven't loaded on this site. To my right is an absolutely true picture of me without any Photoshop.</p>
				<h2>Sublime Text</h2>
				<p>My main text editor for this project has been Sublime Text. I have been using the 2.02 stable build. I figured that it would be better than the "daily" builds of the Sublime Text 3.0. I don't need the features that it has, so I am just sticking to good 'ol 2.02. I have also used Vi for when I need to change something small. I have found it to be very difficult to use. I prefer to use the keyboard if I can, but Vi takes it to a different level. The mouse cannot do anything, no matter how badly you want it to. The only other instance when I voluntarily use Vim is when I am SSHing into my website. I am considering getting a new text editor. The thing that brought me to Sublime Text was the fact that it seemed so powerful. Yes, there are a lot of plugins, but some of them just don't feel like they work right. Most of them do, but it is up to you to get them all figured out. I have also liked the customizability, such as custom keybindings, but I think I wouldn't even need them if I had a text editor with better auto movement of the mouse. That is another thing about ST2. It has very little built in functionality, especially when dealing with HTML, CSS, and JS. It doesn't have attribute autocompletion, CSS only has suggestions for the property name, not the properties themselves, and JS has no function list for autocomplete. I am considering looking into something a little more powerful, like Espresso or Coda 2. I know that I can live publish with those, and I wouldn't have to do a git commit and push and then download that through SSH onto my server.</p>
