				<h1>Codecademy</h1>
				<p>When I first started making basic HTML websites, I had very little knowledge of it. I had prior experience only in a class in eigth grade, one that I did not do too well in, I might add. However, that did begin my interest. I knew that I needed a way to learn how to write the code that was necessary as I had retained very little information from my class in eigth grade, so I looked to Codecademy. I found it very useful. I began with just the HTML, then I worked my way up to CSS. I decided for my personal project that I would also learn how to write JavaScript. I have found Codecademy immensely helpful in figuring out how to write basic JavaScript code. It has also helped me to figure out the basics of PHP, enough to make a basic comment system with the help of an article at least.</p>
				<h1>MDN</h1>
				<p>The Mozila Developer Network has, for me, been absolutely invaluable. It is a near complete documentation of the JS language. It includes many examples, up to date information, and clear and concise usage recommendations. It is a great resource for anyone that uses JS as it can answer any syntax or function related question you might have.</p>
				<h1>w3schools</h1>
				<p>Although it has not always held itself to the best standards, w3schools has proved very useful for me. It contains plenty of information about all sorts of languages, from HTML and CSS, to MySQL, and AJAX, but I only needed the former two. I mostly used it for knowledge about HTML and CSS. They can get very knotty and confusing, especially when you are dealing with positioning and display properties. I occasionally used them for JS too, but I have heard that they are not always the best thing to use for that</p>
				<h1>GitHub</h1>
				<p>One of the requirements for the personal project was that it is well-documented in its creation so that it can be easily discerned that you have not cheated in the process of making it. I was not sure how exaactly to do this at first as almost anyone could have helped me. But, I did realize that GitHub could be very useful in helping me to show my progress and dispell doubts that I didn't create this website. It has also helped me back up my website through commits and pushes. Lastly, it has allowed me to show my progress to others who want to know what I have been doing in the backend.</p>
				<h1>Stack Overflow</h1>
				<p>Everyone who has ever worked with CSS knows how difficult it can be to use. Thankfully, there are thousands if not millions of people who have the same problems as you who all want to solve problems. I have visited many Stack Overflow threads about how to solve problems. It has been invaluable with every aspect of the site: PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS. I do not know how I would have solved some of the problems without it</p>
				<h1>Smashing Magazine</h1>
				<p>Without Smashing Magazine, I do not believe I would have been able to create the commet system. Specifically, I am referring to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/09/building-real-time-commenting-system/">article</a> of theirs. It has helped me understand how servers and PHP work so much better than I could have imagined</p>
