				<h1>Me</h1>
                                <p>Hello, I'm Carl Froneberger. For my personal project, I decided that I would make a website. I thought that it would be a good idea because coding is very important in this modern world. There are many careers that you can go into if you have a knowledge of how to code. I decided that I wanted to get good at it young so that I could have a long time to learn. And what better way than by making a website?</p>
				<h1>ASL</h1>
				<p>I am a fifteen year old guy, and I live in Georgia. I have for my entire life. I like it here, but when I grow up, I'd like to live somewhere a little colder. I have always wanted to live in the Netherlands, Norway, or Germany. I wouldn't be sad living in New York, Chicago, or Seattle, though. When I go to college, I would like to study computer science, chemistry, physics, or math. Right now, I am taking AP Chemistry, and it is somehow my best class. I am also taking AP US History, which is my worst class, unsurprisingly.</p>
				<h1>Developement environment</h1>
				<p>I mostly used Sublime Text 2 for designing offline. However, I find the convenience of live updated much more important than the Sublime Text environment, so I have used SSH to edit information on the site. I have also been using Git as much as possible. I need evidence that I did make this myself, and is there a better way to show that than one hundred git commits?</p>
				<h1>Sports</h1>
				<p>My favorite sport is easily soccer. I follow Arsenal and CPFC. They are my favorite clubss. I also follow Bayern Munich, but only in the Champions' League. Thanks to NBCSN, I can follow the Premier League, but I still cannot follow the Bundesliga, which is where FCB play. I also hope to begin watching ice hockey. Because Atlanta no longer has a team anymore, I have decided to become a Vancouver Canucks fan. Vancouver seems like a very liveable city that I might like to live in</p>
