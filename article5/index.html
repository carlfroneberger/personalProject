I will try to type as fast as I can, however I cannot guarantee that I can type fast enough. There are a few things that are important to do, I guess. This doesn't make any sense at all, does it? I don't think so. I need to start working on my project, but I haven't started, but I need to. This is all just so that Ican insert the image later into my picture. Oh man, this is some terrible writing right here. I hope that I can do better on essays and tests that I/get and do them like that. Oh wow, this makes no sense at all and I still need to type ,and oh, look at that, I need to make the p tag actually close because I think I hit shift space at the same time and because of the key binding that I made, I guess, it did something werid like that. I can't wait to watch some Netflix, though.

					This is the website that I have made for my peresonal project in my Sophomore year of high school. So far, I have enjoyed making it immensely. There are only a few things that I would change. I don't know what to type right now, so I'm just saying the first things that come to my head. I am listening to Spotify right now. Did you know that it is hard to type when you are lying down and your elbows are on the bed? It is not comfortable and it is frustrating. I hope that I can add actual content to this soon. I don't know what HTML Tidy won't work when I do the keybinding. Maybe I need to change it, I don't know. That could be a problem. I hope that I have typed enough, I think I have <a href="index.html">This is a website here</a>
