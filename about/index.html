				<h1>My first website!</h1>
				<p>This is a website about me, Carl Froneberger. I will be updating it periodically with new information. It is a part of my sophomore project. It was made using HTML, CSS, JS, and soon, PHP. There is little actual information on the site, it is only a coding playground right now. I am hosting it on an Ubuntu 12.10 32 bit server. It has 512 MB of RAM and 30 GB of storage. It should be a lot faster than a Raspberry Pi connected to my cruddy internet, so let's see if it pays off. I hope to add a usable PHP comment system as soon as I have time. I also hope to sort the links out as soon as is possible. You will encounter many broken links, stylesheets that haven't loaded, and scripts that haven't loaded on this site. To my right is an absolutely true picture of me without any Photoshop.</p>
				<h1>What it's about</h1>
				<p>I plan to mainly write about my life. What happens in my life? I am not particularly  special; I just needed a purpose for this website. I am mainly trying to gain experience writing code. What do I like? I like t travel, I like soccer, I like coding. Whatever happens to me, I'll probably write about it. If I learn about planes, I will write about them. I will write anything that comes to mind: my favorite types, my favorite airlines, the future of them, anything. However, I am not particularly knowledgeable about anything in particular, so make sure not to trust me too much. My first post will probably be about how I made the website</p>
				<h1>Updates</h1>
				<p>After I have finished and turned in my personal project, I am probably going to be ready to do more with my website. Right now, I am just trying to meet my requirements that I made. However, after that, I'll have more freedom. I'll also have more time as the school year will have finished, and I will have more time for activies. I will probably experiment with different designs, color schemes, and purposes. I will turn it into an HTML and CSS playground.</p>
